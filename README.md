#how does salt influence microbial communities?

Questions:
1. how is microbial community modifiede across a salinity gradient?
	-Null hypothesis: microbial diversity (e.g. richness) does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	-Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase as salt concentration lowers.
		-There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity.
2. how does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	-Null hypothesis: microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	-Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
